Previous programming experience in any language is ideal but not strictly required. Applicants will be judged primarily on their drive and willingness to succeed in a career as a data engineer.</p><h1>Who is the teacher, Brad?</h1><p><a href="/about.html">Read more about Brad.</a></p><h1>Where are the classes?</h1><p>Classes are live, online and recorded. Class attendance is very highly recommended, but "life happens" so classes are recorded for convenience. Students may participate in a live graduation presentation upon completion of the bootcamp, to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><h1>When are the classes?</h1><p>A survey will be sent out to accepted students to find the best time to hold classes. Past bootcamps have had twice weekly live group sessions held from 8-10am, 4:30-5:30pm and in the late evenings 8-10pm Eastern time (USA). One-on-one sessions, pair programming or group work can be scheduled at anytime that works for the participants.</p><h1>I have a day job, can I apply?</h1><p>You can apply! All are welcome, I'll try and fit your schedule where I can.</p><h1>I am from abroad (not the USA), can I apply?</h1><p>You can apply! All are welcome, if you can speak English well and can attend live online courses in the Eastern Timezone (USA) I'd be happy to have you.</p><h1 id="cost">How much does it cost?</h1><p>The bootcamp offers two payment options: an income-dependent payment option (10% of your post-bootcamp income 12 months after the program) OR a mothly payment of $100 for 24 months.</p><h2>Applicants from low-income countries</h2><p>Applicants from low-income countries are encouraged to use the income-dependent option. If your current salary is only $10,000/year (typical in Indonesia, let's say), and the bootcamp helps you get a job for $30,000/year you will only pay $3,000 for the bootcamp. If your salary does not increase you will pay nothing! That is our promise.</p><h2>Applicants from high-income countries</h2><p>Applicants from high-income countries are encouraged to choose the monthly payment option ($100/month for 24 months). If you live in the USA for example, it will be very easy to get a job for $100,000+ (see our salary research for more info). If you choose the "Pay if it works" option and you end up with a job for $100k you'll end up paying over $10,000... which is in line with our competitors pricing, but we think that is too much ðŸ’¸.</p><h2>Why is the bootcamp priced this way?</h2><p>We aim to maintain competitive pricing, and research salaries as well as competitor bootcamps regularly, we are happy to share this reseach to help you make a decision to attend or not. <a href="/datasources.html">Our data sources page</a> links to some of our competitor's websites, their bootcamps often require a upfront payment of over $10,000. We want to deliver high-impact training that dramatically increases salaries for those who need it most, and this pricing structure is our best attempt at doing that. If you have any questions about this please email <a href="mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com">brad@bradflaugher.com</a>. You can also <a href="/datasources.html">review our salary research here.</a></p><h1>What is the curriculum?</h1><p>It is 40% Data Engineering, 30% Data Science, 10% DevOps and 20% Open Source Linux Hacker stuff. I maintain a public repository that you can visit <a href="https://github.com/Medusa-ML/Bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Medusa-ML/Bootcamp</a>.</p><h1>How are applicants screened?</h1><p>Applicants will be screened based on their ability and desire to earn and grow their careers.
