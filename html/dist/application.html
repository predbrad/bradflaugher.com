Previous programming experience in any language is ideal but not strictly required. Applicants will be judged primarily on their drive and willingness to succeed in a career as a data engineer.</p><h1>Who is this Brad guy?</h1><p>Brad is a Data Engineer and former CTO, he works as a consultant and open source data hacker. Teaching this bootcamp is not his/my main business. (I do two of these bootcamps per year because I believe there is a huge shortage of Data Engineers in the world, and gives me warm fuzzy feelings to help people get paid well.) Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradflaugher/">Brad's LinkedIn</a> for more info and feel free to schedule a meeting (see the very bottom of this page) if you want to chat with him.</p><h1>How can I apply?</h1><p>send an email to <a href="mailto:apply@bradflaugher.com">apply@bradflaugher.com</a> with the following:<br>ðŸ’“ Explain your love for data, math, or why you are excited to be a data scientist.<br>ðŸ¤“ Are you ok being a nerd? Tell a short nerdy story about yourself, what is the "nerdiest" personal project you have worked on?<br>ðŸ”— Please include links to your linkedin and github profiles if you have them.</p><h1>What happens next?</h1><p>After your application has been reviewed you will get an email (usually within 2 weeks), if accepted you will be sent the bootcamp contract with payment terms and expectations. you may email apply@bradflaugher.com with any questions.</p><h1>Where are the classes?</h1><p>Classes are live, online and recorded. Class attendance is very highly recommended, but things happen so classes are recorded. Students may participate in a live graduation presentation upon completion of the bootcamp, to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but may also be held elsewhere if there is is a critical mass of students from a particular area (e.g. I did one in Ukraine in 2021).</p><h1>When are the classes?</h1><p>A survey will be sent out to accepted students to find the best time to hold classes. Past bootcamps have had twice weekly live group sessions held from 8-10am, 4:30-5:30pm and in the late evenings 8-10pm Eastern time (USA). One-on-one sessions, pair programming or group work can be scheduled at anytime that works for the participants.</p><h1>I have a day job, can I apply?</h1><p>You can apply! All are welcome, I'll try and fit your schedule where I can.</p><h1>I am from abroad (not the USA), can I apply?</h1><p>You can apply! All are welcome, if you can speak English well and can attend live online courses in the Eastern Timezone (USA) I'd be happy to have you.</p><h1 id="cost">Our salary-based deferred-tuition payment model...<br>AKA How much does it cost?</h1><p>Short answer: if accepted you'll pay a $2k deposit to secure your spot and get your laptop, then you'll pay nothing else unless you get a job paying at least $80k/year, the most you will pay is $10k and you'll only pay that if you get a job for $100k a year, as we allude to in our marketing. Tuition is deferred until you get a job, and the cost is based on your salary, wouldn't in be nice if all education worked that way? We think so.</p><p>The tuition you end up payning depends on how good of a job you land after class. If you get a job for $100k(USD) annual salary or over you'll pay full price for the bootcamp, which is about $10k. If you get a job between $80k-100k you'll pay a prorated rate depending on your pay. If you land a job that pays under $80k you'll pay only the nonrefundable deposit you paid to hold your space and secure delivery of your books and laptop (about $2k).</p><p>We aim to maintain competitive pricing, and research salaries as well as competitor bootcamps regularly, we are happy to share this reseach to help you make a decision to attend or not. Below are some of our competitor's websites, their bootcamps often cost $12-17k and require upfront payment, we want to bring new smart people into data engineering so aim to provide a lower cost bootcamp with tuition payable after you get a job, if you have any questions about this please email apply@bradflaugher.com. <a href="/datasources.html">SEE OUR FULL BOOTCAMP PRICING RESEARCH HERE.</a></p><h1>What is the curriculum?</h1><p>It is 40% Data Engineering, 30% Data Science, 10% DevOps and 20% Open Source Linux Hacker stuff. I maintain a public repository that you can visit <a href="https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp">https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp</a>. You can also see an example of an exceptional student's final project repository at <a href="https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project">https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project</a>. We talk about more than just what goes in the final projects in the class but this offers a good overview, if you have more questions feel free to setup a meeting with me to discuss (see the footer of this page).</p><h1>Can I pay for the bootcamp in Bitcoin (BTC)?</h1><p>Fuck yeah you can! Welcome, crypto nerd. I'll give you a special discount for payments in Bitcoin (about 10%). Let me know you want to pay in BTC before I send your bootcamp contract.</p></section></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container-fluid footer__container"><div class="row footer__row"><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 footer__col footer__col--left"><div class="footer-logo__container"><a class="footer-logo" href="./">Brad Flaugher</a></div><div class="footer__images-list"><a class="footer__images-list-item" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradflaugher/"><img width="30" height="30" src="img/icons/linked-in.svg" alt="LinkedIn" rel="preload"> </a><a rel="nofollow" class="footer__images-list-item" href="mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com"><img width="30" height="30" src="img/icons/mail.svg" alt="Mail" rel="preload"></a></div><div class="footer__menu"><a class="footer__menu-item" href="/privacy.html">privacy</a></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 footer__col footer__col--right"><div class="footer-button__container"><a class="button button--light" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://calendly.com/bradjf">Schedule a meeting</a></div></div></div></div></footer><script id="main-scr" src="js/main.min.js"></script></body></html>
