		<br /> ðŸ’» I've worked for companies large and small, I've started and sold my own <a href="https://inoxoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companies</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/offline-blends-text-audio-and-writer-empowerment-to-create-new-kind-of-ios-publication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built apps</a>, etc...  and worked for huge Mega-Corps (like Johnson &amp Johnson, and Procter &amp Gamble). 
	    
		<br /><br />ðŸ¤“ I am a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-008-9054-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published computational neuroscientist</a> and have been thinking about machine learning and neural networks for longer than I care to admit. I am also married to a <a href="https://www.widener.edu/about/faculty-directory/elisa-esposito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brilliant PhD in Psychology</a> who keeps me honest about any scientific extrapolations I make from my models.

	    <br /><br /> ðŸŽ“ I love to learn and am continuously taking continuing education courses ðŸ™„. Most recently I have been taking courses at <a href="https://executive.mit.edu/course-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT</a>, <a href="https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/for-individuals/all-programs/general-management-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wharton</a> and also watch many <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/playlists/discover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O'Reilly movies on AI/ML</a> for fun. I don't know everything, but I can look almost anything up and learn it when I need to.
	    
	    <br /><br />ðŸ™Œ I love to teach and help people get into <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-be-a-data-scientist-best-job-in-america-2017-9">the best career in America</a>. I started by teaching my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elyseflaugher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little sister</a> how to be a developer and has expanded to annual bootcamps with students from around the world.
