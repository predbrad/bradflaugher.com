			    "Brad is so down to earth and willing to make the time for you when you need help. <strong>He knows the ins and outs of his field and it shows he is so passionate about it.</strong> Brad taught me to be open to other opportunities whether you know it or not and just learn more about it instead of shying away from it. He is the reason I am willing to pursue another skill in my life and I appreciate him for that."
