		<p>The forthcoming book <span class="mark mark--yellow mark--no-xs">by </span><span class="mark mark--yellow no-wrap">Brad Flaugher</span>. 
	    I hope this book helps demystify the world of deep learning as I understand it. I discuss and sometimes answer the following questions:
	    <br />
	    <br /> 💩 What progress in AI is revolutionary and <span class="mark mark--yellow">what is not?</span> 
	    <br /> ✨ What is AI good for? What kind of datasets can we use?
	    <br /> 🎨 Can AI create new things well? Can it innovate by itself?
	    <br /> 🕵️ Are my company and job at risk? 
	    <br />  ☢️ <span class="mark mark--yellow">Can it be stopped?</span>
