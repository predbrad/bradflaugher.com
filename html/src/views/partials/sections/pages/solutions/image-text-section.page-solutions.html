        <div class="content">
		<p>I've worked on projects large and small (<a href="/about.html">more about Brad</a>) and have found the top performing teams manage technology and motivation best by leveraging international teams, open source software and lean heavily into AI and automation from the beginning of projects. This makes products ship 10x faster, and helps increase developer retention while reducing dev costs.</p>
