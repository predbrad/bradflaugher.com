	<h1>Is the bootcamp right for me?</h1>
	<p>The bootcamp is right for you if you have an interest in data and a desire to learn. Previous programming experience in any language is ideal but not strictly required. Applicants will be judged primarily on their drive and willingness to succeed in a career as a data engineer.</p>

	<h1>Who is the teacher, Brad?</h1>
	<p><a href="/about.html">Read more about Brad.</a></p>

	<h1>Where are the classes?</h1>
	<p>Classes are live, online and recorded. Class attendance is very highly recommended, but "life happens" so classes are recorded for convenience. Students may participate in a live graduation presentation upon completion of the bootcamp, to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

	<h1>When are the classes?</h1>
	<p>A survey will be sent out to accepted students to find the best time to hold classes. Past bootcamps have had twice weekly live group sessions held from 8-10am, 4:30-5:30pm and in the late evenings 8-10pm Eastern time (USA). One-on-one sessions, pair programming or group work can be scheduled at anytime that works for the participants.</p>

	<h1>I have a day job, can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, I'll try and fit your schedule where I can.</p>

	<h1>I am from abroad (not the USA), can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, if you can speak English well and can attend live online courses in the Eastern Timezone (USA) I'd be happy to have you.</p>
	
	<h1 id="cost">How much does it cost?</h1>
	<p>The cost of the bootcamp depends on the career outcomes it delivers. The bootcamp does not require a deposit or tuition payment, but applicants will be screened based on their ability and desire to earn and grow their careers. We want to deliver high-impact training that changes peoples careers and lives. To do this we ask each applicant to pay only if the bootcamp helps them exceed their income goals, and wait to ask for payment (our suggested payment, not a legal requirement) after our alumni land great jobs as data-focused engineers.</p>
	<p>We aim to maintain competitive pricing, and research salaries as well as competitor bootcamps regularly, we are happy to share this reseach to help you make a decision to attend or not. Below are some of our competitor's websites, their bootcamps often cost $12-17k and require upfront payment. We want to deliver high-impact training that dramatically increases salaries for those who need it most, for that we ask for payment after the bootcamp and only if we help you exceed your salary goals. If you have any questions about this please email apply@bradflaugher.com. <a href="/datasources.html">You can see our salary research here.</a></p>
