	<h1>Is the bootcamp right for me?</h1>
	<p>The bootcamp is right for you if you have an interest in data and a desire to learn. Previous programming experience in any language is ideal but not strictly required. Applicants will be judged primarily on their drive and willingness to succeed in a career as a data engineer.</p>

	<h1>Who is this Brad guy?</h1>
	<p>Brad is a Data Engineer and former CTO, he works as a consultant and open source data hacker. Teaching this bootcamp is not his/my main business. (I do two of these bootcamps per year because I believe there is a huge shortage of Data Engineers in the world, and gives me warm fuzzy feelings to help people get paid well.) Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradflaugher/">Brad's LinkedIn</a> for more info and feel free to schedule a meeting (see the very bottom of this page) if you want to chat with him.</p>

	<h1>How can I apply?</h1>
	<p>send an email to <a href="mailto:apply@bradflaugher.com">apply@bradflaugher.com</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/bradjf">schedule an interview</a> and discuss the following:
	</br>ðŸ’“ Explain your love for data, math, or why you are excited to be a data scientist.
	</br>ðŸ¤“ Are you ok being a nerd? Tell a short nerdy story about yourself, what is the "nerdiest" personal project you have worked on?
	</br>ðŸ¤‘ Tell us what your salary is now, and what you expect it to be in 1 year.
	</br>ðŸ”— Please include links to your linkedin and github profiles if you have them.
	</p>

	<h1>What happens next?</h1>
	<p>After your application has been reviewed you will get an email (usually within 2 weeks), if accepted you will be sent the bootcamp contract with payment terms and expectations. you may email apply@bradflaugher.com with any questions.</p>

	<h1>Where are the classes?</h1>
	<p>Classes are live, online and recorded. Class attendance is very highly recommended, but things happen so classes are recorded. Students may participate in a live graduation presentation upon completion of the bootcamp, to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but may also be held elsewhere if there is is a critical mass of students from a particular area (e.g. I did one in Ukraine in 2021).</p>

	<h1>When are the classes?</h1>
	<p>A survey will be sent out to accepted students to find the best time to hold classes. Past bootcamps have had twice weekly live group sessions held from 8-10am, 4:30-5:30pm and in the late evenings 8-10pm Eastern time (USA). One-on-one sessions, pair programming or group work can be scheduled at anytime that works for the participants.</p>

	<h1>I have a day job, can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, I'll try and fit your schedule where I can.</p>

	<h1>I am from abroad (not the USA), can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, if you can speak English well and can attend live online courses in the Eastern Timezone (USA) I'd be happy to have you.</p>
	
	<h1 id="cost">How much does it cost?</h1>
	<p>We work for tips, and our bootcamp does not require a deposit or tuition payment, but applicants will be screened based on their ability and desire to earn and grow their careers. We want to deliver high-impact training that changes peoples careers and lives. To do this we ask each applicant to pay only if the bootcamp helps them exceed their income goals, and wait to ask for payment (our suggested payment, not a legal requirement) after our alumni land great jobs as data-focused engineers.</p>
	<p>We aim to maintain competitive pricing, and research salaries as well as competitor bootcamps regularly, we are happy to share this reseach to help you make a decision to attend or not. Below are some of our competitor's websites, their bootcamps often cost $12-17k and require upfront payment. We want to deliver high-impact training that dramatically increases salaries for those who need it most, for that we ask for payment after the bootcamp and only if we help you exceed your salary goals. If you have any questions about this please email apply@bradflaugher.com. <a href="/datasources.html">You can see our salary research here.</a></p>
	<h1>What is the curriculum?</h1>
	<p>It is 40% Data Engineering, 30% Data Science, 10% DevOps and 20% Open Source Linux Hacker stuff. I maintain a public repository that you can visit <a href="https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp">https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp</a>. You can also see an example of an exceptional student's final project repository at <a href="https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project">https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project</a>. We talk about more than just what goes in the final projects in the class but this offers a good overview, if you have more questions feel free to setup a meeting with me to discuss (see the footer of this page).</p>
