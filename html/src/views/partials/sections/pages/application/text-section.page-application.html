	<h1>Is the bootcamp right for me?</h1>
	<p>The bootcamp is right for you if you have an interest in data and a desire to learn. Previous programming experience in any language is ideal but not strictly required. Applicants will be judged primarily on their drive and willingness to succeed in a career as a data engineer.</p>

	<h1>Who is this Brad guy?</h1>
	<p>Brad is a Data Engineer and former CTO, he works as a consultant and open source data hacker. Teaching this bootcamp is not his/my main business. (I do two of these bootcamps per year because I believe there is a huge shortage of Data Engineers in the world, and gives me warm fuzzy feelings to help people get paid well.) Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradflaugher/">Brad's LinkedIn</a> for more info and feel free to schedule a meeting (see the very bottom of this page) if you want to chat with him.</p>

	<h1>How can I apply?</h1>
	<p>send an email to <a href="mailto:apply@bradflaugher.com">apply@bradflaugher.com</a> with the following:
	</br>ðŸ’“ Explain your love for data, math, or why you are excited to be a data scientist.
	</br>ðŸ¤“ Are you ok being a nerd? Tell a short nerdy story about yourself, what is the "nerdiest" personal project you have worked on?
	</br>ðŸ”— Please include links to your linkedin and github profiles if you have them.
	</p>

	<h1>What happens next?</h1>
	<p>After your application has been reviewed you will get an email (usually within 2 weeks), if accepted you will be sent the bootcamp contract with payment terms and expectations. you may email apply@bradflaugher.com with any questions.</p>

	<h1>Where are the classes?</h1>
	<p>Classes are live, online and recorded. Class attendance is very highly recommended, but things happen so classes are recorded. Students may participate in a live graduation presentation upon completion of the bootcamp, to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but may also be held elsewhere if there is is a critical mass of students from a particular area (e.g. I did one in Ukraine in 2021).</p>

	<h1>When are the classes?</h1>
	<p>A survey will be sent out to accepted students to find the best time to hold classes. Past bootcamps have had twice weekly live group sessions held from 8-10am, 4:30-5:30pm and in the late evenings 8-10pm Eastern time (USA). One-on-one sessions, pair programming or group work can be scheduled at anytime that works for the participants.</p>

	<h1>I have a day job, can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, I'll try and fit your schedule where I can.</p>

	<h1>I am from abroad (not the USA), can I apply?</h1>
	<p>You can apply! All are welcome, if you can speak English well and can attend live online courses in the Eastern Timezone (USA) I'd be happy to have you.</p>
	
	<h1 id="cost">Our salary-based deferred-tuition payment model... </br> AKA How much does it cost?</h1>
	<p>Short answer: if accepted you'll pay a $2k deposit to secure your spot and get your laptop, then you'll pay nothing else unless you get a job paying at least $80k/year, the most you will pay is $10k and you'll only pay that if you get a job for $100k a year, as we allude to in our marketing. Tuition is deferred until you get a job, and the cost is based on your salary, wouldn't in be nice if all education worked that way? We think so.</p>
	<p>The tuition you end up payning depends on how good of a job you land after class. If you get a job for $100k(USD) annual salary or over you'll pay full price for the bootcamp, which is about $10k. If you get a job between $80k-100k you'll pay a prorated rate depending on your pay. If you land a job that pays under $80k you'll pay only the nonrefundable deposit you paid to hold your space and secure delivery of your books and laptop (about $2k).</p>
	<p>We aim to maintain competitive pricing, and research salaries as well as competitor bootcamps regularly, we are happy to share this reseach to help you make a decision to attend or not. Below are some of our competitor's websites, their bootcamps often cost $12-17k and require upfront payment, we want to bring new smart people into data engineering so aim to provide a lower cost bootcamp with tuition payable after you get a job, if you have any questions about this please email apply@bradflaugher.com. <a href="/datasources.html">SEE OUR FULL BOOTCAMP PRICING RESEARCH HERE.</a></p>
	<h1>What is the curriculum?</h1>
	<p>It is 40% Data Engineering, 30% Data Science, 10% DevOps and 20% Open Source Linux Hacker stuff. I maintain a public repository that you can visit <a href="https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp">https://github.com/predbrad/bootcamp</a>. You can also see an example of an exceptional student's final project repository at <a href="https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project">https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project</a>. We talk about more than just what goes in the final projects in the class but this offers a good overview, if you have more questions feel free to setup a meeting with me to discuss (see the footer of this page).</p>
	<h1>Can I pay for the bootcamp in Bitcoin (BTC)?</h1>
	<p>Fuck yeah you can! Welcome, crypto nerd. I'll give you a special discount for payments in Bitcoin (about 10%). Let me know you want to pay in BTC before I send your bootcamp contract.</p>
