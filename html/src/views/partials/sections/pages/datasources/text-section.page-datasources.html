	<h1>Data Engineer Salary Data</h1>
	<p>We care deeply about making money for our students, we need to know what the job market looks like for data engineers and have lots of data to support our salary claims. Students should know these numbers as well, especially when negotiating offers for salaries! Two other fun data points to keep in mind are #1 What are the INTERNS making at google (<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/internships/Google/Software-Engineer-Intern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about $53/hr or $110k/year</a>) and #2 what do different types of software engineers make in comparison to each other (<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#salary-comp-total-usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Engineers are at the top end at about $129k median, where designers and front end devs are near the bottom at $108k and $115k respectively</a>)?
