# ADA

## Accessibility Statement

It seems like you're missing an accessibility statement on your website, which is required in some countries. An accessibility statement is important as it (1) shows users that you care about accessibility and about them (2) provides them with info about the accessibility of your content and (3) demonstrates commitment to accessibility and to social responsibility.

Include an accessibility statement that contains a commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities and contact information in case users encounter problems. Here's a sample: "[INSERT COMPANY] is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards."

## Alt Text

It looks like your images are missing alternative text. All of your images should have text alternatives that describe the information or function they represent so that your website is ADA compliant. By adding alt tags, those with disabilities who use assistive technology, such as screen readers, will be able to have the image conveyed in words, rather than by sight. 

Add alt text (alt="") within your image element that describes the function or purpose of the image.

```" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td> <h1><img src="https://bradflaugher.com/Brad.png" alt="BradFlaugher">.COM</h1> <h3>Work:</h3> <p> I w```

## Language Setting

You should set the language for your entire website / webpage to improve accessibility and make your page easier to navigate for screen reader users.

Set the language to the correct language code at the top of your page (lang="").

## Unordered Heading Levels

Correct your heading levels so that they only decrease sequentially and one at a time. It should be ordered like a staircase to make it easier for your users to follow.

## Open Source License Page

It seems like your website doesn’t give any credit to open source software licenses, which is highly recommended if you use open source software for your business or website. Even though not all open source licenses require you to give public credit (such as on your terms of service or acknowledgements page), it is good practice to do so to fully protect your business from potential disputes in the future. 

You can create a separate credits page (an “Open Source Software Acknowledgements” page) or simply acknowledge the open source software you use in your terms of service. Start with a simple line that says “Our services utilize third-party open source software subject to the licenses described below,” and list the licenses you use. Again, this may not be legally required depending on the license, but it is highly recommended that you give credit to all open source licenses as proper etiquette and to avoid any potential disputes.
